ASSIGNMENT REPORT: CORD-19 Research Data Analysis
The CORD-19 dataset, a large collection of COVID-19-related research papers, provides a valuable resource for analyzing publication trends and identifying major research themes.

This assignment focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data from the CORD-19 metadata to uncover publication patterns, highlight active journals, and summarize key topics explored by researchers.
The analysis was implemented in Jupyter Notebook, and an interactive Streamlit application was developed to make the results easily accessible and visually engaging.

OBJECTIVES
The goal of this assignment was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the CORD-19 dataset to:
1. Identify yearly publication trends.
2. Determine the most active journals publishing COVID-19 research.
3. Examine common keywords in paper titles using word frequency and word clouds.
4. Create an interactive dashboard using Streamlit for dynamic data exploration.

DATA OVERVIEW
Source: CORD-19 Open Research Dataset (metadata.csv)
Total records analyzed: 10,000
Key columns:
title, authors, abstract, publish_time, journal, source_x

KEY FINDINGS
1. Publication Trend
- A sharp rise in research activity was observed between 2020 and 2021, aligning with the peak of the global pandemic.
- Publications declined slightly after 2022 as COVID-19 research stabilized.
2. Top Journals
- The most active publishers were Nature, The Lancet, BMJ, and Journal of Medical Virology.
- These journals contributed heavily to early pandemic studies on treatment, prevention, and global health response.
3. Frequent Words in Paper Titles
- Frequent terms included COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, infection, response, and patients.
- This reflects the scientific communityâ€™s focus on disease mechanisms, immunity, and patient outcomes.
4. Word Cloud Visualization
- The word cloud clearly highlighted Human, Infection, Protein, COVID, virus, pandemic, and health as dominant words, confirming key research themes.

STREAMLIT APPLICATION
An interactive Streamlit dashboard was created with the following features:
- Dataset preview: Displays a sample of the dataset.
- Publication trends: Interactive bar chart showing publications by year.
- Top journals: Visual display of the 10 most active journals.
- Word cloud: Graphical visualization of common words in paper titles.
- Year range slider: Allows users to filter and focus on specific publication years.

CHALLENGES
- Data acquisition: The dataset was very large, which made loading and processing slow. To manage this, a smaller subset of the data was extracted for faster analysis.

- Handling missing values: Several records had missing publication dates and journal names, requiring careful filtering to maintain data quality.

- Streamlit integration: Running Streamlit from Jupyter initially caused compatibility warnings and file path confusion. This was resolved by creating a separate app.py file.

- Library setup: Some visualization libraries like wordcloud were not pre-installed and had to be added manually.

-   Maintaining consistent data references: Ensuring the same cleaned dataset (metadata_clean.csv) was used across both the notebook and the Streamlit app.
